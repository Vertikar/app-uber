## Weather Pane
Ninja Sphere - Application that adds a weather pane to the LED Matrix

*Under Construction*
This will be used as the first example of an application that uses the LED + Gesture interface

To use you'll need a config.json with the app secrets.

You probably want to run it from your mac like this:

```go build && DEBUG=* ./app-uber --led.host elliotsphere2.local --mqtt.host elliotsphere2.local```
